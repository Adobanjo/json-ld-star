# JSON-LD 1.1*

This is the repository describes extensions to [JSON-LD 1.1][], [JSON-LD 1.1 API][], and [JSON-LD 1.1 Framing][] to support triples as node identifiers as defined by [RDF-star]
developed by the [JSON for Linking Data Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/json-ld/). The editorsâ€™ draft of the Note can also be [read directly](https://json-ld.github.io/json-ld-star/).

The JSON-LD-star Test Suite is a set of tests that can
be used to verify JSON-LD Processor for the RDF-star extensions to JSON-LD.

More information and an RDFS definition of the test vocabulary can be found at [vocab](https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-api/tests/vocab).

## General instructions for running the JSON-LD Test suites

Tests are run broadly the same as those for the core JSON-LD test suite, with the addition of the `rdfstar` option set to `true` for each test. If not set, explicitly, the test checks for proper behavior when not operating in RDF-star mode.

## Running tests

The top-level [manifest](manifest.jsonld) references the specific test manifests, which in turn reference each test associated with a particular type of behavior.

Implementations create their own infrastructure for running the test suite. In particular, the following should be considered:

* For JSON-Ld-star tests, the `specVersion` is set to `JSON-LD-star`.
* Some tests may have a `requires` property, indicating some optional behavior described by a test vocabulary term. Tests that use JSON-LD-star functionality have `"requires": "JSON-LD-star"` specified.

## Contributing Tests

If you would like to contribute a new test or a fix to an existing test,
please follow these steps:

1. Notify the JSON-LD Community mailing list, public-linked-json@w3.org,
   that you will be creating a new test or fix and the purpose of the
   change.
2. Clone the git repository: git://github.com/json-ld/json-ld-star.git
3. Make your changes and submit them via github, or via a 'git format-patch'
   to the [JSON-LD Community Group mailing list](mailto:public-linked-json@w3.org).
